# A [Giter8 template](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/Combined+Pages.html#Usage) for production-grade scala-sbt starter code [for usage with sbt new](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/sbt-new-and-Templates.html) #

For more information (quite a lot of information) about what's included in this quickstart, [refer to /src/main/g8/README.md](https://github.com/sbchapin/quickstart-scala-sbt.g8/blob/master/src/main/g8/README.md).

This information will come along with the template, so you may just want to get on with that.


## To get started immediately: ##

```bash
sbt new sbchapin/quickstart-scala-sbt.g8
```

Execute the preceding `sbt` command wherever you want to start a new scala-sbt project.  **It will create a new folder in your active directory.**

It will ask you three questions:

- `name` - _will be formatted to the correct type in necessary places (META-INF, packages, README...)_
- `organization` - _must be in the reverse-namespace format._
- `package` - _must be in the reverse-namespace format (will default to the last two fields intelligently.)_


## Requires: ##

- `sbt` 1.x or higher (or an older sbt with giter8 plugin configured)
- little-to-no [understanding of giter8 or sbt new](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/sbt-new-and-Templates.html)
